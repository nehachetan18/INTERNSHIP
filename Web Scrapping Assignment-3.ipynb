Only stayed for one night between travels so wasn't looking for social (so can't comment on that) but this place is perfect if you need a friendly safe and comfortable night with great travel links.\", \"I think what Hostelworld guests like most about our property is the character of our building, a beautiful Victorian listed mansion. Our helpful staff are also highly rated. \\nWe've got some great unique features, like lots of free under-bed storage and custom-made bunk beds with curtains and nightlights for extra privacy. There's also an onsite bar where you can meet other people and join our theme nights; plus, we also stock several pub games and a Wii. I really feel that we're ideal for budget-concious travellers who want to experience boutique accommodation without sacrificing the social element that can only be found in hostels.\\nWe're located less than 20 minutes' walk from Hampstead Heath, Abbey Road, Regents Park and Primrose Hill.
